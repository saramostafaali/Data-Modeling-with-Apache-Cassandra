# Data-Modeling-with-Apache-Cassandra

# Project Description
-	I created an Apache Cassandra database for a startup called Sparkify that wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new   music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. 
-	The data reside in a directory of CSV files, so I built an ETL pipeline to transform the raw data into the Apache Cassandra database.
